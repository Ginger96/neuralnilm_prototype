# neuralnilm

Early prototype for the Neural NILM (non-intrusive load monitoring)
software.  This software will be completely re-written as the [Neural
NILM project](https://github.com/JackKelly/neuralnilm).

Directories:

* `neuralnilm` contains re-usable library code
* `scripts` contains runnable experiments
* `notebooks` contains IPython Notebooks (mostly for testing stuff
  out)
